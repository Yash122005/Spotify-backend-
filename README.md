# ☁️ ImageKit Integration

This project uses **ImageKit.io** to store and deliver music files efficiently.

### Why ImageKit?

* Fast **CDN delivery**
* Secure **file uploads**
* Optimized **media storage**
* Scalable cloud media management

### Example Upload Flow

1. Artist uploads a music file
2. Multer stores file temporarily in memory
3. File is uploaded to **ImageKit**
4. ImageKit returns a **public URL**
5. The URL is stored in the database
6. Users stream music using the ImageKit URL

Example configuration:

```javascript
const ImageKit = require("imagekit");

const imagekit = new ImageKit({
  publicKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY,
  privateKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  urlEndpoint: process.env.IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT
});
```
